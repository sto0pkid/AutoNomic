An elliptic curve can be defined as a plane curve defined by a polynomial
equation of the form

y^2 = x^3 + ax + b

where a and b are real numbers. This type of equation is called a 
Weierstrass equation.

The definition further requires that the curve be non-singular, i.e. has
no cusps, self-intersections, or isolated points. Algebraically, this
holds iff. the discriminant: 

 D = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2) is not equal to zero.


These are also called "p-functions"

The p-functions constitute "branched double coverings" of the Riemann
sphere by the torus, ramified at four points.
