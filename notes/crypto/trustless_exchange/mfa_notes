Possibility 1:

Both parties set up a multi-factor authentication wallet that they are
both factors of. 

Whatever coins get sent to this wallet can't leave unless both
parties sign the transaction.

So if one party sends coins to the wallet, they can be assured that
these coins won't exit unless they personally sign the transaction
for it. They might not be able to get the coins back out unless the
other party signs their side of the transaction, but they can be
assured that the other party will not be able to get them.

Now they want to exchange.

Somebody's gotta act first. Let's say it's me.

So I make a transaction to send my asset to some wallet that you control.

A					B
------					---------
unsigned transaction to B		unsigned transaction to A


I sign this transaction and send it off to you. Now you can sign
it and send it off without making the transaction back to me. In other
words, now you can steal my asset.

A					B
-------					---------
transaction to B			transaction to A
 signed by A				 unsigned
					transaction to B
					 signed by A



A					B
-------					---------
transaction to B			transaction to A
 signed by A				 unsigned
 signed by B				transaction to B
 sent					 signed by A
					 signed by B
					 sent
Ok so, instead I make this transaction and I *don't* sign, and send the
unsigned transaction to you. 


A sends unsigned transaction to B

A					B
---------				--------
transaction to B			transaction to A
 unsigned				 unsigned
					transaction to B
					 unsigned

Ok now B can't send off that transaction without A signing it, so
A is safe so far. 

But B wants this transaction to B to get sent, so B signs that     
transaction and sends it back to A.


A					B
----------				--------
transaction to B			transaction to A
 signed by B				 unsigned
					transaction to B
					 signed by B


Ok now I can send my asset to you at my discretion, whenever I choose to
sign it.

Now of course B doesn't want to sign the transaction to A and send it to
A, because then A can just send it off without sending the transaction to
B.

So B sends the unsigned transaction to A.

A					B
------------				--------
transaction to B			transaction to A
 signed by B				 unsigned
transaction to A			transaction to B
 unsigned				 signed by B

Now A obviously wants this to get sent, so they'll sign it and send it
back to B.

A					B
------------				---------
transaction to B			transaction to A
 signed by B				 signed by A
transaction to A			transaction to B
 signed by A				 signed by B


Now, B can send to A, or A can send to B, but neither can send to themselves.

But we're still stuck in a situation of somebody must act first.

Let's say A acts first again:

A					B
------------				----------
transaction to B			transaction to A
 signed by A				 signed by A
 signed by B				transaction to B
 sent					 signed by A
transaction to A			 signed by B
 signed by A				 sent


B wins again.

Now, let's imagine that given a transaction signed by both factors,
and have the information to sign for one of the factors, you can
sign for both factors.

Then by receiving the transaction to B signed by B, A could use that
information to sign the transaction to A, without sending the transaction
to B.

So let's say instead A makes a transaction to A and signs it and sends it
to B. B makes a transaction to B and signs it. 

A					B
-----------				-----------
transaction to A			transaction to A
 signed by A				 signed by A
					transaction to B
	 				 signed by B

Now if B signs the transaction to A, they can reveal the secret
to sign their transaction to B. Now once that goes onto the chain,
A can see it and that will reveal the secret for them to sign
their transaction to A, but by that point it may be too late, as B
could make another transaction to B and sign for both.

Ok so that's too much.

Can we relativize it to a particular transaction.

A					B
------------				------------
transaction to B			transaction to B
 signed by A				 signed by A

So B will obviously sign and send this transaction.
So let's say
