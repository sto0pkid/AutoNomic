Possibility 2:

Party A and party B set up a 2-of-2 multi-factor authentication wallet.
Both Party A and party B send the assets they want to exchange to this
wallet. B communicates to A where they want the coins to be sent, and
A signs a multi-output tx sending B's asset to A's wallet and A's asset
to B's wallet. B signs this tx and sends it through.

All good, trustless exchange.

The only problem: the black-hole & extortion problem.
