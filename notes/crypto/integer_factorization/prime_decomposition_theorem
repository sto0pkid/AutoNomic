Every natural number >= 2 is equal to some product of powers of primes.
Further, this product is unique.

2 = 2^1.

If all numbers between 2 and n (inclusive) factor into a product of primes, 
then n+1 factors into a product of primes.
Assume (n+1) does not have any factors other than 1 or itself, then it's
prime and so the decomposition as a product of primes is (n+1) = (n+1)^1, and
we're done.

Otherwise, assume (n+1) has factors p,q such that 1 < p < (n+1) and
1 < q < (n+1). 

Then p factors into a product of primes, prod{i=1...inf}{p_i^s_i} and so does 
q, as prod(i=1...inf}({p_i^t_i}

so, p*q = prod(i=1...inf){p_i^(s_i + t_i)}

Which is a product of primes.
