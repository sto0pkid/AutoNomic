Given two proofs p and q of a == b, should p and q necessarily be identical?
Traditional models of type theory validate this property, i.e. uniqueness of
identity proofs.

Hofmann & Streicher showed that it's not implies by the typical axioms of
type theory, by means of a countermodel in which types are groupoids.
