Model theory.

So, we have some scribbles written on a page, like
"a : A"
"G, x : A |- B"
etc..

I give you "A" and tell you it's a "type". You think, "Oh ok,
types are basically like sets."

Wrong, types are a class of syntactic objects in this language,
they aren't necessarily anything other than scribbles on the
page that are allowed to fit in certain syntactic configurations
with the other symbols.

When you think that types are sets, what you're doing is providing
an interpretation or "model" for those scribbles.
