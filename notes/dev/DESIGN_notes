Place a decentralized CPU into the global FPGA
This is not a regular CPU
Regular computers operate based on what you tell them to do, if you 
don't tell them what to do they just sit there and don't do anything.
The global FPGA is already running though, people are
already computing. If left to its own devices (no pun), computation
will simply happen.
The control of the operation of the decentralized CPU is based on what 
you tell it *not* to do.
Consensus on state of the decentralized execution environment will be
maintained by a block-chain overlay network.
