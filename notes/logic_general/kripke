Modal operator [] = "necessarily"
Modal operator <> = "possibly"

<> is classically the dual of [], and may be
defined in terms of necessity:
<>A = ~([](~A))

A Kripke frame is a pair (W,R) where W is a (possibly empty) set
and R is a binary relation on W. Elements of W are called nodes
or "worlds", and R is known as an "accessibility relation".

A Kripke model is a triple (W,R,||-) where (W,R) is a Kripke frame
and ||- is a relation between nodes of W and modal formulas, such that:

* w ||- ~A iff not w ||- A
* w ||- A -> B iff (not w ||- A) or w ||- B
* w ||- []A iff u ||- A for all u such that w R u
