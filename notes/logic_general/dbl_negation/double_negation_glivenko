Glivenko's theorem, 1929

If P is a propositional formula, then P is a classical tautology
iff. ~~P is an intuitionistic tautology.

If T is a set of propositional formulas, T* a set consisting of the
double-negated formulas of T, and P a propositional formula, then
T |- P in classical logic iff. T* |- ~~P in intuitionistic logic.

In particular, a set of propositional formulas is intuitionistically
consistent iff. it is classically satisfiable.

By the Curry-Howard correspondence, we see that intuitionistic
proofs have computational content. By the double-negation elimination,
we see that classical proofs also have computational content.
