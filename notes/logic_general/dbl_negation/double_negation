Intuitionistic can be included in classical logic by forgetting some distinctions between
propositions. Example, A -> A, A v ~A, and ~~A -> A can be seen as "refinements" of the
classical proposition A v ~A, since they all become equivalent when interpreted in classical
logic.

Double negation is the same as the CPS translation of types, mapping
types to their continuation monads.

Running programs in CPS is the same as combining double-negation and
A-translation.


Negation == type-constructor for non-returning computations (continuations)
