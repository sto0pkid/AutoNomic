Liar:
"This sentence is False".
X = X is False
X = not X

Grelling:
A word/phrase is "heterological" if it does not describe itself.
"long"
"cold"
"German"

Quine:
'yields falsehood when applied to its quotiation' yields falsehood when applied to its quotation.

The word "heterological" literally means 'yields falsehood when applied to its quotation', therefore Grelling paradox == Quine paradox.


A slightly more precise formulation:
'yields a false statement when applied to its quoation' yields a false statement when applied to its quotation.


Findlay:
The new sentence obtained by substituting the name of the sentence 'the new sentence obtained by substituting the name of the sentence x for the variable in it is false' for the variable in it is false.
