Markov's principle: for a quantifier free formula P

MP1:
~~Ex x . P  => Ex x . P


in Heyting Arithmetic (HA)



MP2:
[All x [P v Q]], [~ All x P] => [Ex x . Q]


MP2 -> MP1


Friedman translation:


P*		= P v (Ex x.Q)
(B v C)*	= B* v C*
(B ^ C)*	= B* ^ C*
(B => C)*	= B* => C*
(all x . B)*	= all x . B*
(ex x . B)*	= ex x . B*
_|_*		= Ex x.Q


If B is provable in HA, then so is B*:

Case 1:
 If P is provable in HA, then so is P* = P v (Ex x.Q).
 Use the proof of P as the left disjunct for P v (Ex x.Q)

Case 2:
 If (B v C) is provable in HA, and
  * hyp1 = if B is provable in HA then so is B*
  * hyp2 = if C is provable in HA then so is C*
 then so is (B v C)* = (B* v C*)
 If (B v C) is provable in HA then either B is provable or
 C is provable. Assume it's B, then B* is provable by hyp1
 and so we can use that as the left disjunct for (B* v C*).
 Assume instead that it was C, then C* is provable by hyp2
 and so we can use that as the right disjunct for (B* v C*).

Case 3:
 If (B ^ C) is provable in HA, and
  * hyp1 = if B is provable in HA then so is B*
  * hyp2 = if C is provable in HA then so is C*
 then so is (B ^ C)* = (B* ^ C*)
 If (B ^ C) is provable in HA then both B and C are provable.
 By hyp1 and hyp2, both B* and C* are provable and thus
 by ^-intro we can prove (B* ^ C*)

Case 4:
 If (B => C) is provable in HA, and
  * hyp1 = if B is provable in HA then so is B*
  * hyp2 = if C is provable in HA then so is C*
 then so is (B => C)* = B* => C*.
 If B => C is provable then C is provable under the assumption that
 B is provable. If C is provable under the assumption that B is provable
 then C* is provable under the assumption that B is provable. 
 If we assume B is provable, then by hyp1 we can assume B* is provable.
 And then we get C* is provable under the assumption that B* is provable?
  * seems I'm fudging some details there

Case 5:
 If (all x . B) is provable in HA, and
  * hyp1 = if B is provable in HA then so is B*
 then so is (all x . B)* = (all x . B*)
 If (all x . B) is provable then ....


Case 6:
 If (ex x . B) is provable in HA, and
  * hyp1 = if B is provable in HA then so is B*
 then so is (ex x. B)* = (ex x . B*)
 If (ex x . B) is provable then ....


Case 7:
 If _|_ is provable in HA then Ex x. Q is provable in HA
 If we have a proof of _|_, then apply principle of explosion
 and get the proof of Ex x. Q




If B = ~(all x . ~Q) then B <-> (Ex x . Q)

If ~(all x .~Q) is provable in HA, with Q quantifier-free, then 
so is (ex x . Q).
