There exist transcendental numbers (numbers that are not the roots of any polynomials with coefficients in the integers). 

Nonconstructive proof:
Thanks to Cantor in 1874
The polynomials with coefficients in the integers are countable.
 * Requires subproof
Therefore the set of algebraic numbers is countable.
 * Requires subproof
However the reals are not countable
 * Hence there must be reals which are not algebraic, and hence transcendental.
 * Further there must be uncountably many transcendental numbers.

This is non-constructive because it claims the existence of transcendental numbers
without actually demonstrating one.
