The logical constants True and False

In propositional logic:
True 	= T
False 	= F

Just some constants, that obey the truth-table relations.


In set theory logic:
True	= set of all elements
False	= empty set


In constructive logic:
True	= singleton set
False	= empty set


In category-theoretic logic:
True	= terminal object
False	= initial object


In lattice logic:
True	= Top
False	= Bottom
