All the formulae of an FOL theory can be enumerated.
Assume we are given an FOL proposition P.
Then we can loop through all the formulae in our theory
and check each one to see if its a well-formed proof of P.
If P has a proof, then our algorithm will eventually find it.
However if P doesn't have a proof, then our algorithm will potentially
loop forever trying to find it.
However, if we can solve the halting program, we can simply ask
if our program halts on input P. If it halts, then P must be
provable, and if it doesn't halt, then P must be unprovable.
Due to Godel's completeness theorem, every valid formula is provable,
so this method would decide (the validity of) every statement of FOL.
