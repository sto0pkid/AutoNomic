but then, on terminal:

A→B <-- does it render the characters overlapping for you? nah, looks fine to me.

ah hrm i thought this showed us the same view, guess not
well it shows us the same character buffer, but our terminal emulators can interpret those differently.
what emulator are you using? you may have to enable unicode or something. λ that shows up though?
β and this? yea they all show up they just sometimes overlap.. weird. it's a local terminal setting for you
I'm pretty sure. gotcha yea that makes sense, i'm not sure what emulator i'm using let's see if i can
figure that out. for instance, I use xterm
looks like gnome-terminal. Might check online to see how to enable  unicode or see if others have a sim- issue.
'apparently they do and apparently the standard solution is a "monospace" font so that they all have fixed width
ahh yes, that's v weird that it does not use one by default. all terms shoould use a monospace font.
I'm a fan of "Meslo". what's even weirder is that it doesn't used fixed character width but then still
positions the characters according to a fixed grid. it has to considering the terminal is just a rectangluar character buffer.
would get mighty fucked real quickly otherwise I bet
There we go
You shouldn't have told me about this now my Agda's gonna fill up with unicode :D
:(
huh?
we on the term

∀x∃y,
very nice
you got it?
yep, i don't seem to have this Meslo font available but Monospace Regular works
Yeah you would probably have to download it from your package manager or elsewhere.
