Dollar Index Futures
--------------------
Started 1973 after the dismantling of the Bretton Woods system

weighted geometric mean of the dollar's value relative to
EUR		57.6%
JPY		13.6%
GBP		11.9%
CAD		9.1%
SEK		4.2%
CHF		3.6%

USDX goes up when USD gains strength relative to these currencies
Needs:
* China
* Mexico
* Brazil
* South Korea
* Vietnam
...
should just be an index against all the currencies, you'd think...
I wonder why it wasn't made that way to begin with.


Trade-weighted US dollar index
----------------------------
Introduced in 1998. The Euro was introduced and USDX is just kind of 
obviously a bit insufficient.

Improves on USDX by including more currencies and updating the weights
yearly, rather than never.
