Lambda theories:
Lambda-beta		Least lambda theory
Lambda-beta-eta		Least extensional lambda theory


Lambda-beta is the unique smallest lambda theory.
Nabla = L*L:  is the unique inconsistent lambda theory. Inconsistent because
it equates all lambda-terms.
Lambda-theory H equating all unsolvable lambda-terms.
Lambda-theory H* the unqiue maximal consistent extension of H.

"Sensible" lambda theories
"Semi-sensible" lambda theories

Solvable vs. unsolvable lambda terms.

A lambda-theory is a congruence on the set of all lambda terms, with
respect to the operators of lambda abstraction and application, which
contains lambda-beta.

A lambda-theory T is consistent if T =/= L*L.
* At least two lambda-terms must not be equal.
* Inconsistency means everything's equal.
* If T is a binary relation on L specifying which terms are equal,
  then if T = L*L that would imply all terms are equal.


A lambda-theory T is extensional if T contains lambda-beta-eta
* Equivalently, if T contains I = 1.

The set of all lambda theories has the cardinality of the continuum.
The set of all lambda theories has the structure of a complete lattice.
* Meet(T,S) = intersection(T,S)
* Join(T,S) = least equivalence relation that includes union(T,S).
* Lambda-beta is the bottom element.
* Nabla is the top element.
* This lattice is continuum-wide, continuum-broad, and continuum-high.


Two lambda theories are incompatible if their join is L*L.
An antichain of LambdaTheory is a set of lambda-theories that are pairwise
  incompatible.
A lambda-theory generated by a set of equations is the least lambda-theory
  containing those equations.
