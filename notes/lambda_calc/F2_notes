F2 = Second-order polymorphic lambda calc

Girard: representation theorem
* Every function on natural numbers that can be proved total in
  second order intuitionistic predicate logic P2 can be represented
  in F2.

  Projection of P2 to F2.

Reynolds: abstraction theorem
*
 
  Embedding of F2 into P2.

Composition of Girard-projection & Reynolds embedding is the identity.
