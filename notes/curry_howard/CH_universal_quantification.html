Universal quantification.
<br><br>
Given some domain of objects A, and some proposition P about those objects, you can form the statement
<br><br>
"For every object in A, the proposition P holds about that object"
<br><br>
P is actually not just one single proposition, like, "The sky is blue", it's a family of propositions, like "x is blue", where "x" is a variable that can take on values in A.
<br><br>
So we can say something like:
<br><br>
"For every blueberry x, x is blue"
<br><br>
This family of propositions P (also known as a "type family") can be regarded
as a function taking objects in type A and returning a proposition specialized
to that object. So in this example it's a function that takes a blueberry as
input and gives back as output a proposition that asks whether or not that
blueberry is blue:
<br><br>
P(x) = x is blue
<br><br>
So, given some blueberry, call it "my_blueberry", we can apply this function 
to it to get a proposition asking whether "my_blueberry" is blue:
<br><br>
P(my_blueberry) = "my_blueberry is blue"
<br><br>
So we can write our statement above like so:
"For every blueberry x, P(x)"
<br><br>
In standard math language this would be written something like:
∀ x ∈ blueberry , P(x)
<br><br>
In type theory languages like Agda this might be written something like:
"(x : Blueberry) -&gt; P x"
<br>
<br>
In constructive logic, if you want to prove that every blueberry is
blue, you have to construct a proof that x is blue, for every blueberry
x.

TODO:
<br>
* Universal quantification is like a generalization of implication
<br>
* Evidence for the truth of a universal quantification can be witnessed by a dependent function
<br>
* Dependent function is like all the pairs in a dependent product, whereas the dependent product is just one of the pairs
<br>
  * Use the picture of a graph of a function
<br>
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)#Definition
<br>
  * A computable function is like a compression of the pair-space  
<br>
* Relationship to fiber-bundles/fibrations
<br>
  * Again, use pictures, you get it when you can visualize it
