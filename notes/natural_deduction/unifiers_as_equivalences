Paper "Unifiers as Equivalences"

present unification problems as a "telescope": a list of
types where each type can depend on values of the previous types
Each type in this telescope corresponds to one equation of the
unification problem, and the dependencies reflect the fact that the
type of each equation can depend on the solutions of previous equations.
This allows to keep track of dependencies between equations precisely.

Second, unification rules are presented as *equivalences* between
two telescopes of equations. For example, injectivity of the constructor
suc : Nat -> Nat is represented by an equivalence between the equations
suc m == suc n and m == n.

Heterogenous equations vs. homogeneous equations

Turning a heterogeneous equation between terms of the same type
into a homogeneous one requires the K axiom which is equivalent to
UIP.

It is unsound to postpone an equation and continue with the next
one when working with heterogenous equations.

Telescope mappings (functions between telescopes) can be thought of
as substitutions:

f : G -> G'

Given:
G' |- u : A, then

G |- u[G'\(f G)] : A[G'\(f G)]
