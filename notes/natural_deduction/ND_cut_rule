The cut rule:

G |- A , D    G', A |- D'
-------------------------
G, G' |- D, D'

Categorical semantics:

Each sequent is interpreted as a morphism in some category.
The cut rule asserts the existence of composition of morphisms.
How?


A |- A is interpreted as the identity morphism.


Cut-elimination theorem:
Every theorem that has a proof using the cut rule has a proof not using it.

Modularity of type-theoretic connectives:
Each connective is given by rules which involve only that
connective and its arguments, and no other connectives.

Subformula property:


Relationship between cut-elimination and adjunction


Elimination of cuts is dual to elimination of identities
* Analogous to how beta is dual to eta
