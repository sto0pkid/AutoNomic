./builtins.cpp:19:46 < HMC_a> stoopkid: it returns with ?l and ?x left as unbound vars!  It returns "?l rdf:first ?x"... in the "result graph" this is a top level statement, so the vars are considered as existential!  So it returns exactly a statement interpreted as "there exists a list l and a node x such that x is the rdf:first of l" which is ofc tautologicaly true regardless of what the kb state is. ;-)
./builtins.cpp:<HMC_a> sure, and I'm not against doubling up on some builtins later... maybe in the end we have list:append, tau:append, and tau:concat, with tau:append taking just a subject of a pair list of a list and a literal and doing an actual "append" and the other two both being "concat"...
Binary file ./jsonld_tau.o matches
Binary file ./tau matches
